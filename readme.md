This is my Thesis Engineering "From raster to 3D model â€“ Preparing data for 3D printing with a Python plugin in the QGIS environment"

This project create 3D model based on raster data in STL format.

I learned OOP (Object Oriented Programming) from Mark Lutz "Introduction"

The most important code you can see in create_model.py file.

Below you can see libraries which I used to create this plugin:

-PyQt
-Scipy
-MatPlotLib
-Numpy
-NumpySTL
-PySTL
